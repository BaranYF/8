# Campus Health Center Medicine Tracker

Assignment 2 for frontend class. Made a medicine tracker for our campus health center.

## What it does

- Add medicines with name, maker, expiry date and how many we have
- Shows everything in a table 
- Can remove medicines we dont need
- Saves data so it remembers everything when you come back
- Shows if stuff is expired or running out
- Works on phone too

## Stuff i learned

- Classes and inheritance (took me a while to get this)
- Making forms that check if you filled everything
- Saving data in browser 
- Making unique IDs for each medicine
- Working with dates in javascript

This one was way harder than the star wars site but i think i understand classes better now. The inheritance thing made no sense at first.

## How it works

Each medicine needs:
- Name (like Paracet)
- ID number (made automatically) 
- Who made it
- When it expires
- How many boxes we have

It shows different colors if medicines are expired or almost gone.
