# Campus Health Center Medicine Tracker - Assignment 2

Assignment 2 for frontend development class. Made a medicine inventory tracker for our campus health center.

## What it does

- Add medicines with name, manufacturer, expiry date and quantity
- Shows everything in a table format
- Can remove medicines that are no longer needed
- Saves data in browser storage so it remembers everything
- Shows warnings if items are expired or running low

## What I learned

- Classes and inheritance in JavaScript (took me a while to understand this)
- Making forms with proper validation
- Saving data in localStorage 
- Generating unique IDs for each medicine
- Working with dates in JavaScript

This assignment was more challenging than the Star Wars site but I think I understand object-oriented programming better now. The inheritance concept was confusing at first but makes sense now.
