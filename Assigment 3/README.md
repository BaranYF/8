# Expense Tracker - Assignment 3

Simple expense tracker built with React for the frontend development assignment.

## What it does

- Add expenses with title, amount, date and category
- Shows expenses in a table format
- Calculates total amount automatically  
- Delete expenses with confirmation dialog
- Form validation for required fields

## Notes

Focused more on getting React to work than making it look fancy. Used some design ideas from my previous assignments to save time. Had to troubleshoot quite a bit to get everything working. React setup was challenging but I got there eventually.
