# Expense Tracker - Assignment 3

Simple expense tracker built with React for the frontend assignment.

## What it does

- Add expenses with title, amount, date and category
- Shows expenses in a table
- Calculates total automatically  
- Delete expenses (asks for confirmation)
- Form validation for required stuff

## Notes

Focused more on getting React to work than making it look fancy. Borrowed some ideas from my other assignments to save time. Had to troubleshoot a lot to get everything working, React setup was pretty tricky but got there in the end.
