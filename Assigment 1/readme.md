# Star Wars Website

My assignment for frontend development class. Shows characters, planets, vehicles and movies from Star Wars.

## What it does

- Shows 4 different categories with 6 items each
- Gets data from Star Wars API 
- Has pictures for each item
- Works on mobile too
- Dark theme with red colors

This was a really nice project to work on since i love Star Wars and recently rewatched all of the prequel george lucas movies. It was fun picking out my favorite characters and planets to display on the site.
