# Cinelist - Final Project (Work in Progress)

A movie watchlist app I'm building for my final project assignment. This is the current progress showing the basic structure and functionality.

## Current Features
- Search movies using TMDb API
- Add/remove movies from watchlist (saved locally)
- Basic login/signup forms (demo only for now)
- Filter movies by genre and year
- Movie details modal
- Responsive design

## Still To Do
- Set up Webpack bundler
- Implement real Firebase authentication
- Better form validation
- Deploy to hosting platform
- Code organization into proper modules

## Notes
- Currently using localStorage for watchlist
- Authentication is just demo (no backend yet)
- Planning to add user profiles and movie ratings

This represents my progress so far, the basic functionality works but I still need to implement the advanced requirements.
